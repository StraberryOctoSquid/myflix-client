# Retrospective
## myflix app
- What went well? 
- What could have gone better? 
- What features would I like to add. 
- What information would I need to implement these changes.
- This process will help me in future projects and hopefully benefit me in interviews.

### Learning
A lot of my thoughts about this project are related to learning.
I feel like I spent a lot of time/energy trouble-shooting. And that is the biggest thing that I've learned in this corse so far.
<p>
Sometimes I'd make mistakes and not follow the directions closely enough. Sometimes following the directions to the "T" was the mistake, as they were either out-dated or in-accurate. The lesson here is to follow directions precisely, and if things are not working as expected, throw the instructions out and look elsewhere for solutions.
<p>
I had a lot of technical issues with Heroku, and MongoDB. Some of my issues were software related. At times it could feel like digging through these problems was not the purpose of the exercise. In the moment it was not clear that this was time well spent.
<p>
In retrospect I believe that all of my time spent solving problems will make me better at solving problems.
<p>
 I may never use Heroku again. If I do, hopefully I don't run into the same problems. If I do run into the same problems, I likely won't remember the solutions. But, my ability to troubleshoot and the confidence that growing those skills has given me, will allow me to persevere!
